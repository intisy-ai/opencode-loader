// (commands.ts) and core/dist must be INLINED. tsc's multi-file output left a
// `./commands.js` import that can't resolve from the deploy dir, so the loader
// failed to load and `oc`/`cc` were never installed. esbuild inlines it all.
// (The TUI is a separate process — core-loader/dist/tui.js — and stays external.)

// proxy.ts is the opt-in proxy daemon (run standalone via `node dist/proxy.js`);
// it imports core-loader's startLoaderProxy + opencode-proxy's routing engine, so
// it must be bundled to stay a single self-contained file with no runtime
// cross-submodule dependency. (proxy-boot.ts stays inlined into dist/plugin.js
// via plugin.ts's import — it only runs in-process during activate().)
